Project Name: Minesweeper Project Description

The Minesweeper game is a single-player puzzle game where the player aims to clear a grid of hidden mines without detonating any of them. The player is provided with a grid where some cells contain mines. The objective is to uncover all cells that do not contain mines. If a player clicks on a cell containing a mine, they lose the game. If the player successfully uncovers all non-mine cells, they win. The game provides three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Hard, each with different grid sizes and mine counts.

Key Features
1. Single-player mode with three difficulty levels.
2. Real-time minefield interaction and cell uncovering.
3. Visual representation of the minefield and discovered cells. 4. Win/loss determination and result announcement.
5. Timer to track the duration of the game.
